# scrape-challenge
## This is Module 11 Challenge. 

### Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News (part_1_mars_news.ipynb)
* Use automated browsing to visit the Mars news site and inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
* Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to extract text elements from the website.
* Extract the titles and preview text of the news articles that you scraped. Store the scraping results in Python data structures.
* Optionally, store the scraped data in a file.

### Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data (part_2_mars_weather.ipynb)
* Use automated browsing to visit the Mars Temperature Data Site and inspect the page to identify which elements to scrape.
* Create a Beautiful Soup object and use it to scrape the data in the HTML table.
* Assemble the scraped data into a Pandas DataFrame. The columns should have the same headings as the table on the website.
* Examine the data types that are currently associated with each column.
* Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the desired questions. 

### Attached folder and files :
* Two jyputer notebook files(part_1_mars_news.ipynb, part_2_mars_weather.ipynb), the resulting json file (mars_news.json) from part 1, and the resulting csv file from part 2 (mars_data.csv). 
* One REDME file
